I can't get it out of me
It's breathing inside of me
It's reaching inside of you
You're feeling infected
You're being infected
It's just like the cold
A kiss on your lips
Now you're taking control

I feel like a criminal
I'm falling apart
We're leaving for Venus
In a getaway car
'Cause no one can save us
There's no need to try
I'm looking for saviours
Before they all die

If you want to try and save me
Then take my heart don't hate me
If you feel you can't let go then let go

I feel like a criminal
I'm falling apart
We're leaving for Venus
In a getaway car
You say that you haunt me
But you don't really know
You're clinging to fingers
But you gotta let go

If you want to try and save me
Then take my heart don't hate me
If you feel you can't let go then let go

Let go...

If you want to try and save me
Then take my heart don't hate me
If you feel you can't let go then let go
